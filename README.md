The assignement was to make a web application that showed a map that has animated marker on it. The main direction was to show "Activety".

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project you need to have Node.js installed(https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in order to have access to npm commands.
To get all the dependecies first run 'npm install' this will take a minute so relax.

Once all the dependecies have beed loaded you can continue with the scripts below.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
